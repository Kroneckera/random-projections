auto vertices = generate_regular_polygon(6, 2.0);
Polygon hexagon(vertices);

// Define projection direction
ProjectionCalculator::Direction direction = {1.0, 0.5};

// Create calculator for interior projections
ProjectionCalculator calc(hexagon, direction, Region::INTERIOR);

// Calculate exact expected distance
double exact_dist = calc.exact_projected_distance();

// Calculate Monte Carlo estimate
double mc_dist = calc.monte_carlo_projected_distance(10000);

// Calculate average Euclidean distance
double avg_dist = calc.exact_average_distance();
```

- ‚úÖ Error handling improved and comprehensive
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Python bindings have compatibility issues when loading the C++ module
- ‚ö†Ô∏è pybind11 module loading fails with GIL acquisition errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Python tests cannot currently run with C++ implementation
- ‚úÖ C++ tests now run successfully after installing GTest via Homebrew and configuring static linking

  1. RegularPolygonProjections: Updated test to use correct analytical formula 7*‚àö2/30
  2. ExactAverageDistance: Fixed analytical formula (2+‚àö2+5*ln(1+‚àö2))/15
  3. ErrorHandling: Added proper validation for negative integration_order
  4. Fixed all build warnings related to integer sign comparison

### Detailed Issue Analysis

#### Convexity Check Implementation
- ‚úÖ Updated convexity checking algorithm to properly handle collinear points
- ‚úÖ Implemented option to check for counter-clockwise vertex ordering
- ‚úÖ Tests updated to reflect correct geometrical definition of convexity
- ‚úÖ Added robust 2œÄ turn check to detect self-intersecting polygons

#### Projection Tests Failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 1: Error Handling in exact_average_distance()**
  - The `exact_average_distance()` method (in integration.cpp) does not validate the `integration_order` parameter
  - Test expects an exception for negative values, but the implementation only enforces a minimum value of 4
  - Fix needed: Add explicit validation and throw std::invalid_argument for non-positive values
  - This is causing the ErrorHandling test in projection_tests.cpp to fail

- ‚úÖ **Issue 2: Analytical Value Mismatch for Interior**
  - Unit square interior average distance had incorrect formula in test
  - Original formula: (2.0 + 2.0*sqrt(2.0) + 5.0*log(1.0+sqrt(2.0)))/15.0
  - Corrected formula: (2.0 + sqrt(2.0) + 5.0*log(1.0+sqrt(2.0)))/15.0
  - Current numerical integration produces value: ~0.52140543316484167
  - Corrected analytical value: ~0.52140543316484167
  - Status: Fixed by updating test to use correct formula

- ‚úÖ **Issue 3: Boundary Average Distance Formula**
  - Unit square boundary average distance formula was incorrect (4/3)
  - Corrected formula: 1/4 + sqrt(2)/12 + 5/12 * ln(1 + sqrt(2))
  - Test updated with correct analytical formula
  
- ‚úÖ **Issue 4: Boundary Projected Distance Formula**
  - Unit square boundary projected distance formula was correctly identified as 11/24 (approximately 0.458333)
  - Fixed implementation using a mass-based approach for boundary projection
  - Properly decomposed steps into elementary intervals and point masses
  - Corrected integration formula for E[|X-Y|] by integrating F(x)(1-F(x)) over the range
  - All tests now pass with high accuracy matching both analytical values and Monte Carlo results

## Build Status

The C++ core library compiles and builds successfully. Most basic features work as expected:
- Polygon creation and basic operations (area, perimeter)
- Point projection and sampling
- Boundary and basic interior projections

However, there are some issues with more advanced functionality:
- Interior projection calculations sometimes throw "Total mass should be 1.0" exceptions
- Average distance calculations show discrepancies with theoretical values
- Python bindings have been implemented but have compatibility issues when loading
- C++ tests can be run using static linking with Homebrew's GTest implementation

## Dependencies

- C++17-compatible compiler
- CMake 3.14+
- Python 3.7+ (for Python bindings)
- NumPy (for Python interface)
- pybind11 (for Python bindings)
